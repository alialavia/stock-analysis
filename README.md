### Technical Indicators
- **Moving Averages**: Calculated using 20-day and 50-day periods
  - 20-day MA = Average of last 20 closing prices
  - 50-day MA = Average of last 50 closing prices
- **RSI (Relative Strength Index)**:
  - Calculated using 14-day period
  - Values above 70 indicate overbought conditions
  - Values below 30 indicate oversold conditions

### Options Analysis
- Options data is fetched from Yahoo Finance
- Open Interest Value = Open Interest Ã— Last Price
- Options chains are organized by expiry date and strike price

## Troubleshooting
